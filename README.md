NegabinGLM: Negative-binomial regression model

4 sets of analysis: donor level T cells, donor level B cells, single cell lever T cells, and single cell level B cells.

For each analysis, 5 files are generated: 
- The ranking of top genes with corrected p-value
- The top gene counts for each donor/cell
- The distribution of corrected p-value
- The distribution of corrected p-value after filtering high p-values
- The heatmap of top genes, normalized by total counts of top genes and the total count of each gene
